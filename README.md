# GOAL
To apply knowledge of Bootstrap and SASS to build a responsive front end for a social media application.

## Brief

You are tasked with creating 3 pages in HTML using Bootstrap and SASS:

1. Homepage
2. Profile page
3. Login page

The Homepage should have a feed of posts from the user’s contacts, a search bar, and a form to create a new post.

The profile page should have a profile image, details about the user, a list of the user’s contacts, their posts and a form to post to their wall.

The login page should have a form to login to the application.

You will only be working on the visuals for this project at this stage, forms do not need to submit data, for example.

Submission for this project will follow the pattern used in professional development. You are required to seek feedback from your peers as well as the teachers in order to complete this assignment.
